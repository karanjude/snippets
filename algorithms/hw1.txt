2. Hardy decides to start running to work in San Francisco city to get in shape. He prefers a route that goes entirely uphill and then entirely downhill so that he could work up a sweat uphill and get a nice, cool breeze at the end of his run as he runs faster downhill. He starts running from his home and ends at his workplace. To guide his run, he prints out a Google Maps report detailing the roads with m road segments (any existing road between two intersections) and k intersections. Each road segment has unit length, and each intersection has a distinct elevation. Assuming that every road segment is either fully uphill or fully downhill, give an efficient algorithm to find the shortest path (route) that meets Hardy’s specifications. If no such path meets Hardy’s specifications, your algorithm should determine this. Justify your answer.

Ans:
======

We have a starting point - hardy's home. Lets call this 'S'
We have an ending point - hardy's work. Lets call this 'E'

Claim
------
Now for some vertex v there would be a path such that sum of the shortest path from 'S' to v and from v to 'E' is minimized.
We are provided with a map with 'm' road segments or edges, 'k' intersections or vertices. Each of these vertices has a value which is equal to its elevation 'H'. 

Since we need to find a route that goes entirely uphill and then downhill, we need to find a vertex that satisfies our claim.

Consider 2 cases

Case 1:
-------
We need to find the best shortest uphill path from 'S' to some vertex 'V'.
We can use a modified version of Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm to find the shortest paths from 'S' to all vertices.We then store all these vertices and their path cost in an array uphill cost array, where each entity in the array represents the uphill cost from 'S'. 

Case 2:
-------
We need to find the best shortest downhill path from 'V' to some vertex 'E'.To find the downhill costs we can again use Dijkstra but this time we find single source shortest path from 'E' to all points except 'S'. We then store all these vertices and their path cost in an array downhill cost array, where each entity in the array represents the downhill cost to 'E'. 
 
In both the cases above we ignore edges which are not totally uphill in nature or totally downhill in nature. In other words in case 1 we only consider edges that are uphill and in case 2 we only consider edges that are downhill.

Once we have calculated the uphill and downhill distances for all vertices then for very vertex in vertex set,
we calculate the sum = uphill_distance[v] + downhill_distance[v] , the vertex having the minimum sum is the desired vertex 'D'
and the shortest path is the shortest path from 'S' to 'D' and from 'D' to 'E'

the path can easily be printed using the uphill parent and down hill parent array. Also if either uphill_distance and downhill_distance for all vertex is not complete we say there is no path. An uphill or downhill distance is not complete if the uphill or the down distance for that vertex is INFINITY. ( or in other words no proper path exists)

Algorithm
----------
hardy_shortest_path(S, E, V):
1  build graph from google maps having edges 'M' and 'K' vertices
2  run DIJKSTRA_UPHILL from 'S' on the graph
3  run DIJKSTRA_DOWNHILL from 'E' on the graph
4  V = find vertext having the shortest uphill and downhill cost by running SHORTEST_UPHILL_DOWNHILL_VERTEX(V)
5  if -1 == v:
6    print "NO SOLUTION"
7  else:
8   print shortest path from S to v and v to E by running PRINT_PATH(S,V, uphill_parent) and PRINT_PATH(V,E, downhill_parent)

step 1 cost => O(M + K)
step 2 cost => O(M lg K)
step 3 cost => O(M lg K)
step 4 cost => O(K)
step 8 cost => O(M)

so total cost is dominated by step 1 hence total cost => O(M + K)

Question 3
----------
Aaron is trapped on an island with hungry velociraptors. He is currently at a safe location s, and he wants to get to the boat t which will get him home. There are many paths through the island, represented as a directed graph. Each edge e has a probability pe that a traveler along this edge will be eaten by a raptor. If we select a path P from s to t, the probability he arrives safely is 
psafety = Πe∈P (1 − pe ).
(a) (10 pts) Give an efficient algorithm which maximizes the probability he arrives safely.Hint: consider what happens when you take the log of psafety .Note: Please do not feed your instructor to hungry dinosaurs.

(b) (15 pts) After escaping Raptor Island, Aaron finds himself on Treasure Island. The island forms a directed graph of which he is currently at a start node s. Each edge has weight ∈ {0, 1, ..., K}. Each node has buried treasure, but he can’t carry the treasure
from more than 1 node simultaneously without returning to his ship at s. Therefore, he wants to find the shortest path from s to all other nodes in the network (you need not worry about return paths). Give an O(K|V | + |E|) algorithm to determine these paths.


Answer 3(a)
----------- 
We need to find a path that maximizes the probability of Aaron reaching safely. This is equivalent to saying that we need a path which minimizes the probability of being eaten.

since p(eaten) = productof( p[e1] * p[e2] * ... p[en]) where p[e(i)] is the probability of getting eaten at the i-th edge.

since log(p[eaten]) = sumof(log(p[e1]) + log(p[e2]) + log(p[e3]) ... log(p[en]))

We can construct a graph and assign log(p[e(i)]) as probability to each and every edge. Since log of probabilites can be added 
now we can easily construct a shortest path from 'S' to 'T' using Dijkstra shortest algorith

Algorithm
---------
1  Build the graph
2  Assign log[p(e)] for every edge in the edge set E
3  Run DIJKSTRA(S,G,V) on G, where G is the graph and V the vertex set of G
4  print the path from S to T using PRINT-PATH(S,T, parent)


// this array stores the probability weights for all edges
probility = []

// this is a map for all the edges 
edge_weight = {}

// this represents the parent of a given vertex V
parent = []

 if (probility[v] > probility[u] + edge_weight(u,v)):
  probility[v] = probility[u] + edge_weight(u,v)
  parent[v] = u


Answer 3(b)
===========
Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm gives the shortest path from a given node 'S' to all nodes.
If the priority queue is implemented using Fibonacci Heap then the total run time is 
O(|V| lg V + |E| ) since KV is a upper bound on V lg V, he have an algorithm that run in O(K|V| + |E|)


// d is the distance array for very vertex
// parent stores the parent of every vertex
// w is the edge map for vertices
// Q represents the priority queue 

DIJKSTRA(G, w, s):
 INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, S)
 S = {}
 Q = V[G] 
 while !Q.empty():            
  u = EXTRACT-MIN(Q)
  q.pop()	
  s = s union u 
  
  // for every neighbor of u
  for vertex v in Adj[u]:	      
      Relax(u, v, w)


INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s):
for v in V[G]:
 d[v] = INFINITY
 parent[v] = None
d[s] = 0

Relax(u, v, w):
 if d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v):
  d[v] = d[u] + w(u,v)
  parent[v] = u


Question 4
------------
We are given a weighted connected graph G = (V, E) which has a vertices and b edges. For a given path P between any two vertices u and v in G, we define dP (u, v) to be the weight of the maximum edge on path P .
(a) Explain how you can use the minimum spanning tree T of a graph G to determine the path P with minimum value dP (u, v) between two specified vertices u and v.

(b) Prove the correctness of your method for part a.

Solution 4(a)
-------------

MST by definition is a Tree that spans all the vertices and contains edges with smallest possible weights. According to problem definition Every path P in the graph is supposed to contain a max edge dp(u,v). Since the spanning tree spans over all vertices of the 
graph , any 2 vertices 'u' and 'v' of the graph would be part of the spanning tree. 

For all the path possibilities between 'u' and 'v', each on of them would contain an of type dp(u,v). A path between 'u' and 'v' which lies on the spanning tree, would then by the definition of spanning tree contain the least expensive among the set of 
dp(u,v) edges. Hence MST of a graph G will contain the path P with minimum dp(u,v) between two specified vertices 'u' and 'v'.


Solution 4(b)
--------------
for the sake of simplicity lets assume that the path between 'u' and 'v' on the MST constitutes a single edge path. Now this single edge path contains an edge dp(u,v). Lets assume this edge dp(u,v) that is part of the spanning tree is not the cheapest edge dp(u,v). So then there is some edge dp(u,v)' which we can choose such that cost(dp(u,v)') < cost(dp(u,v))

If that is the case 'v' can be reached from 'u' through another edge, which basically implies that there is a cycle in the spanning tree. But since spanning tree is a tree and it cannot have cycles. There fore the edge dp(u,v) that is part of the spanning tree is the minimum dp(u,v) that can be part of the spanning tree.
