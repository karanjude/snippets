2. Hardy decides to start running to work in San Francisco city to get in shape. He
prefers a route that goes entirely uphill and then entirely downhill so that he could work up
a sweat uphill and get a nice, cool breeze at the end of his run as he runs faster downhill. He
starts running from his home and ends at his workplace. To guide his run, he prints out a
Google Maps report detailing the roads with m road segments (any existing road between two
intersections) and k intersections. Each road segment has unit length, and each intersection
has a distinct elevation. Assuming that every road segment is either fully uphill or fully
downhill, give an efficient algorithm to find the shortest path (route) that meets Hardy’s
specifications. If no such path meets Hardy’s specifications, your algorithm should determine
this. Justify your answer.
